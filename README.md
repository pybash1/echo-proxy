# echo-proxy

This is the Proxy that connects the [echo](https://github.com/pybash1/echo) and [echo-mac](https://github.com/pybash1/echo-mac) apps to the database.

Just set up the environment variable for the database(`DATABASE_URL`) and host it on Vercel, Railway, or whatever platform you prefer.

You must use a PostgreSQL database. You can host one on Supabase, they also offer a simple and generous free tier.
